Endowed app, created by Our team, lets a Customer see how much money has already been earned 
from the life endowment program, provided by the Bank and update the amount of money Our  
Customer wants to top up monthly to his already saved money account.

Endowment Insurance programs give a Customer an opportunity to earn more than salary by 
getting both payment from official income and additional payment from company by not paying
the pension tax to the government. 

Our app is open to expand when a Customer can have an additional job
and change the amount of money Our Customer wants to send to his endownment account this month. 

Besides that, due to program a Customer does not have to send any additional documents and sign 
new applications to change the monthly rate of the money amount he wants to pay from his monthly salary, 
because now he can do it from Our Endowed application.
